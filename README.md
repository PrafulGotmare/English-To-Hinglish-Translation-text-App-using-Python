Creating an English to Hinglish Translation App using Python, HTML, CSS, and deploying it on the Streamlit Cloud platform involves several steps. Streamlit is a popular framework for creating interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects.

# 1. Setup Environment and Dependencies:

* Install required Python packages: streamlit, mtranslate.
* Create a new directory for project and navigate to it in terminal.

# 2. Run file on local system:
* python app.py
* This command will start the server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running.
* It will typically indicate that the app is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
* Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see your Hinglish translation app's interface.
* You can enter English text in the text area, click the "Translate" button, and view the Hinglish translation.
